## üéì PhD Thesis

**Title**: [Simulations of Electron Detection Systematic Errors for a UCNA+ Experiment](link-to-your-thesis)

- **Abstract**: The UCNA+ experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory is an upgrade to the original UCNA experiment, aiming to measure the neutron beta asymmetry A0 with a precision of 0.2% or better, nuclear structure-independent value for the CKM matrix element Vud. In this study, we present results from **GEANT4 simulations of the UCNA+** experimental setup, focusing on necessary backscattering corrections. 
- **Keywords**: Electron Backscattering, Geant4 Simulations, Detector Physics, Data Analysis, UCNA+, MCMC
